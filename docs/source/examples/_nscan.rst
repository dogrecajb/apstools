Example: the :func:`~apstools.plans.nscan()` plan
==================================================

We'll use a Jupyter notebook to demonstrate the :func:`~apstools.plans.nscan()` plan.  
An *nscan* is used to scan two or more axes together,
such as a :math:`\theta`-:math:`2\theta` diffractometer scan.
